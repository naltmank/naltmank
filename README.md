## Hello!

My name is Noam Altman-Kurosaki. I'm a marine ecologist interested in the mechanisms that drive coral reef decline and recovery. I'm currently a Postdoc with the Smithsonian MarineGEO program. I received my BA in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University in 2016, my MSc in Marine Biology from the University of Hawai'i at Manoa in 2019, and my PhD from Georgia Tech in 2025.

## Research Interests

While my interests are broad, I tend to take an experimental approach to understand how interactions between corals, algae, and fish are affected by stressors at global and local scales. While I consider myself a field ecologist at heart, I've recently become more involved with broader synthesis research. My current postdoc involves examining environmental and anthropogenic drivers of fish and invertebrate community structure, allowing me to combine classic survey-based approaches with my more recently acquired quantitative skills.
